### üóÇÔ∏è Data Variables

| Variable              | Type        | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`               | `principal` | Address with special permissions              |
| `min-donation`        | `uint`      | Minimum donation threshold                    |
| `withdrawal-limit`    | `uint`      | Max allowed withdrawal per recipient          |
| `required-signatures` | `uint`      | Signatures needed to execute critical actions |
| `tx-nonce`            | `uint`      | Incremental ID generator for transactions     |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functions

#### üîß Admin Functions

* `set-admin(new-admin)` ‚Äì Change contract administrator
* `set-min-donation(amount)` ‚Äì Set minimum donation amount
* `set-withdrawal-limit(amount)` ‚Äì Set withdrawal limit
* `set-required-signatures(amount)` ‚Äì Adjust number of required multisig approvals

#### üìñ Read-only Accessors

* `get-admin()` ‚Äì Returns current admin address
* `get-min-donation()` ‚Äì Returns current minimum donation requirement
* `get-withdrawal-limit()` ‚Äì Returns current withdrawal limit
* `get-required-signatures()` ‚Äì Returns number of required signer approvals

---

### üîç Validation Rules

* `validate-donation(amount)` ‚Äì Ensures donations meet minimum requirement
* `validate-withdrawal(amount)` ‚Äì Ensures withdrawals are within allowed limits

---

### üîê Multisig Governance

| Function                              | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `add-signer(new-signer)`              | Add a new signer (admin-only)                  |
| `remove-signer(signer)`               | Remove an existing signer (admin-only)         |
| `propose-transaction(action, params)` | Submit a new multisig transaction for approval |
| `get-pending-transaction(tx-id)`      | View transaction details                       |
| `get-tx-nonce()`                      | View the latest transaction nonce              |
| `is-signer(address)`                  | Check if an address is a recognized signer     |

> `execute-transaction(tx-id)` is a private function that would be invoked internally once sufficient approvals are collected.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Codes

| Code   | Meaning                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `u401` | Unauthorized access                        |
| `u402` | Invalid donation or transaction parameters |
| `u403` | Invalid configuration or signer state      |
| `u404` | Not found / invalid address                |
| `u405` | Withdrawal amount exceeds allowed limit    |

---

## üîê Security Considerations

* Prevents admin assignment to zero address (`SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78`)
* Limits transaction parameter sizes and count
* Uses nonce to avoid ID collisions in pending transactions
* Allows only valid signers to propose/approve multisig actions
